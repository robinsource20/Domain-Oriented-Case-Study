# Domain-Oriented-Case-Study
All BFSI institutions are faced with a major default problem: not every individual that takes a loan has the willingness, ability and/or integrity to pay it back. Thus, an average of 2-5% default rate is observed across banks for different loan categories like personal loan, education loan, vehicle loan, business loan etc. Given the fact that banks can never get this number to zero, it has to keep it within limits, and rather keep it at the lowest possible levels to be able to retain the money inflow.
